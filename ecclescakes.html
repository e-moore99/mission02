    <h3>Method:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The night before; melt the butter, and mix the butter, brown sugar, and
        cinnamon together into a caramel. Add to the currants and mix. Cover and
        allow to marinate.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 180Â°C. Defrost the pastry.</li>
      <li>
        Cut the pastry into squares. Place a few tablespoons of filling and
        pinch the pastry closed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn the eccles cake over so the closing is underneath it, and squish it
        down into a patty shape.
      </li>
      <li>Repeat this process until you have used all of the filling.</li>
      <li>
        Place the eccles cakes on a baking tray, allowing space for them to
        puff.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a sharp knife, score the top making 3 parallel lines. Brush the
        tops with milk and sprinkle with white sugar.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake until golden brown, 15-20 mins. Eccles cakes are best enjoyed warm.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Notes:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I have found this ratio uses an entire packet of pastry so if you halve
        it you will have pastry leftover.
      </li>
      <li>
        I tend to use a coarser sugar on top like demerara as I think the
        texture is nicer, but it doesn't really matter what you use.
      </li>
    </ul>
